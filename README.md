# facebookBot
I made a bot that talks to your friends, read an input and answer them thanks to a Machine Learning Algorithm

You need the following packages:

   Selenium and 
  
   Chatterbot
  						
              
              
 You need to train your bot first, so uncomment the code below line 61 and run once. Later on, comment again the training section, and run normally the code. Enter your Facebook credentials and name of the person you want to talk with.
 
 Note: You will need to install drivers for your web. E.g Chrome, Firefox, etc.
 
 Note2: Read all the comments through the code.
 
 Thanks.
